				<h2> I like to go swimming in the summer.</h2>
				<p>Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining </br>and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an </br>impressive pool, only three feet deep, but it's mine.</p>
				<p>
					There are three reasons I like to swim:
					<ul>
						<li>I get lots of exercise</li>
						<li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
						<li>I have an opportunity to be  in the sun.</li>

					</ul>
