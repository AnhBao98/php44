	<h1>I like to go to swimming in the summer.</h1>
	<p>Swimming is my favorite activity in the summer.when the sun is shining<br />
	 and the air is warm, you wil find me dipping into my backyard pool.It's not an <br />impressive pool, only three feet deep, but it's mine </p> <br />
	<p>There are the reason I like to swim:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I get lots of exercise</li>
		<li>I enjoy the freedom </li>
		<li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun </li>
	</ul>
