		<br>
		
	<p style="margin: 0px 250px;">Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining and the air warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard pol.It's not an impressive poll, only three deep, but it's mine.</p><br>
	<p style="margin: 0px 250px">There are three reasons I like to swim:</p>
	<ul style="margin: 0px 250px">
		<li>I get lots of exercise</li>
		<li>I enjoy freedom</li>
		<li>I have opportunity to be in the sun</li>
	</ul>
