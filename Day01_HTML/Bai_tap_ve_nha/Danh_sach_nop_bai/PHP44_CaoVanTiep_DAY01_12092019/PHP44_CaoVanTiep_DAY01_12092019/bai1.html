		<h1> I like to go swimming in the summer.</h1>

		<br />

		<p>Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining <br />
		and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an <br /> 
		impressive pool, only three feet deeep, but it's mine.</p>

		<br />

		<p>There are three reasons I like to swim:</p>
		
		<br />

		<ul>
			<li>I get lots of exercise</li>
			<li>I engoy the freedom</li>
			<li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun.</li>
		</ul>
